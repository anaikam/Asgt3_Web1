Vivian Ha and Anaika Mehra

Vivian's Contribution: Anaika and I pair programmed for most of the
assignment. I mainly figured out how to use flask for cookies,
formatting, forms, tables and url linking for the html files.
I also tested all the programs and worked on making sure that the
style of the page matched the reference program. We generally worked
simultaneously to fix any errors and figure out the assignment. In
this, I mainly learned Flask and Jinja for the first time but used
my previous skills in HTML for the assignment.

Anaika's Contribution: Vivian and I pair programmed for the majority
of the assignment. I figured out how to get the second webpage to
display, handled errors by creating the error.html page, and tested
all the programs. We worked on the other HTML pages together. I figured
out how to get user's text input to stay post search. I also worked on
classid errors and learned ways to detect changes mid-program. We both
attended office hours separately to get our doubts cleared. I learned
HTML coding for the first time and also used Flask and Jinja for the
first time.
